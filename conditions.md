# ARM Condition Codes

ARM condition codes can be added to any valid ARM op-code (but not pseudo-instructions or directives). The condition code comes *after* any instruction suffixes.

An instruction with a condition code will be executed conditionally. Note that if the instruction is not executed there is no state change except for PC increasing to the next instruction. The non-executed instruction takes one cycle, whatever the execution time of the instruction when it is executed.

**Examples**

```
MOVEQ
STRBVC
ADDSGE
LDMFDNE
```

|LT| Signed &lt; | N &#x2260; V |
|GT| Signed &gt; | Z clear and N = V |
|LE| Signed &#x2264; | Z set or N &#x2260; V |
